                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jordan played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the official NBA website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time". He won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls.

                    <br>
                    <h3>Chicago Bulls (1984-1993)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers).
                        In the 1985-1986 playoffs, Jordan scored a still standing playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics. This Celtics team was considered one of the greatest teams of all time. The Bulls were swept in the playoffs that year by the Celtics, but Chicago knew it had something special.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From 1984. to 1993. Jordan won 3 NBA championships in years 1991., 1992., 1993.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1991, Michael finally got over the hump and beat the Lakers for his first NBA title. There was also a signature move in that game when Jordan jumped to the hoop and avoided a possible blocked shot by Sam Perkins. He switched hands mid-air in order to avoid the block and he made the layup. The shot has been replayed constantly ever since.

                    <h3>First retirement (1993-1995)</h3>
                    <p>
                        On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.
                        Jordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox.

                    <h3>Chicago Bulls (1995-1998)</h3>
                    <p>
                        On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: "I'm back." Jordan was freshly motivated and started training hard.
                        Bulls leaded by Jordan managed to win 3 more NBA championships in years 1996., 1997. and 1998.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Second retirement (1999-2001)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters
                    </p>
                    <h3>Washington Wizards (2001-2003)</h3>
                    <p>
                        On September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks. Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Final retirement (2003)</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the recognition that 2002-03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation. The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.
