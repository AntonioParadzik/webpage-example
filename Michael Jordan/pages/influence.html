                            Michael Jordan has had an impact on society more than any other NBA player in his generation. His success on the court led to a widespread increase in the popularity of the NBA, and it hasn't been the same since. Television ratings increased only during his time in the league. The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title. As late as 2020, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.

                            Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. Several NBA players, including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up. In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players "the next Michael Jordan" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.

                            Michael Jordan's fame brought along endorsements and advertising. The most notable endorsement was the <b>Nike Air Jordan</b> shoe brand. It was the first shoe to be created that was sponsored specifically by an Athlete. As popularity started to grow increasingly with Michael Jordan as the best basketball player in the world, the shoe popularity grew as well. Even after Jordan's basketball retirement the Air Jordan brand still remains as one of the most popular athletic sneaker on the market. Michael Jordan has not only changed the game of basketball, but he has also changed the game of merchandising and consumerism.
